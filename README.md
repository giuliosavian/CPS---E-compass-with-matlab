## Intro Of The Project
This project has been made by myself from the cyber physic system course in the university of Padua and it use matlab mobile connected to the phone. The phone is a E-compass while the results are diplayed in the PC through matlab.

In this project we want to realize a very simple electronic compass by using the magnetometer embedded in your smartphone. 

At the purpose, it is useful to firstly analyze and understand the signals acquired from the  magnetic field sensor when the smartphone is rotated, clockwise and counterclockwise, around its z axis.

The second step corresponds to a calibration in order to estimate the North position.

Finally, you must develop a user interface like a compass by monitoring, at the same time, the inclination of the smartphone respect to the horizontal surface (in fact in order to employ the smartphone as electronis compass the smartphone should be kept horizontally).
